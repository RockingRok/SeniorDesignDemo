# SeniorDesignDemo

This is a mix of our stuff, TRN stuff, yolo stuff. There was some working directory issues with both modules so I dropped them all off into root.

The model+classes can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rwaY6baBP_oHQZJMziadqfqLvTmsmZhx?usp=sharing

## How to set this up

Start with anaconda? Maybe give them a list of packages?

The important files are for the demo: webcam.py

For the removed video uploading if they want it: webapp_backend.py, test_TRN.py, and yolo_webapp.py
